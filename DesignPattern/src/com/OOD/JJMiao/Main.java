//Design a maps path-building navigator client.
//User should be able to build path from point A to point B using your code.
//Your design should support different transportation methods for example: walk, car, bus, bike.

//Navigator is building different paths depending on what TransportBehavior it has.
//WalkTB, BusTB, CarTB are different strategies (algorithms) that are being executed, when client asks Navigator to build path from Location A to Location B

//PathNode is a node that has previous and next PathNodes in a path. (doubly linked list)
//For simplicity of solution we omit implementing algorims to build Doubly linked List of PathNodes for different transplrt types.

//Location is a latitude and longitude dot on a map
